<h3>
    Determining your forefoot width:
</h3>
<p>
    To determine the width of your forefoot, you can leave the measuring tape identical as before. The '0' mark lies directly against the wall as before. This time, however, your foot is parallel to the wall with the outside facing the wall. Now you can read the width of the forefoot at the joint of the big toe.

<p>
    Again, please measure the right and the left foot. If the result is different, note the larger value in cm.
