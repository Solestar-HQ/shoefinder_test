<h3>
    Determining your instep circumference:
</h3>
<p>
    If you don't have a tape measure at hand, you can also use a string to measure the circumference. Then place it on a ruler or tape measure to read off the cm.

<p>
    Again, please miss the right and the left foot. If the result is different, write down the larger value in cm.
