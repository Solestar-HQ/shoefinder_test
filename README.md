Shoefinder is a web app for entering foot data to find the right cycling shoes based on length, width, and height. 
The need for the web app stems from the special lasts used in cycling shoes and the limited opportunity to try on shoes in specialist stores. The tool is aimed at bike fitters and specialist retailers, who can use it to recommend the best shoes for end customers as part of their shoe consultation service.
